- `format`: `json`, `protobuf`
**Description:** HTTP requests arriving at VictoriaLogs endpoints. Counts all requests immediately when received, before any validation or authentication happens.

### vl_http_errors_total
**Type:** Counter
**Labels:**
- `path`: endpoint path
- `reason`: `wrong_basic_auth`, `wrong_auth_key`, `unsupported`

### vl_http_request_errors_total
**Type:** Counter
**Labels:**
- `path`: endpoint path
**Description:** Failed request processing in internal cluster endpoints (`/internal/select/*`). Currently only tracks errors for cluster communication endpoints, not public API endpoints like `/select/logsql/query` or `/insert/jsonline`.

## Data Ingestion Metrics

### vl_rows_ingested_total
**Type:** Counter
**Labels:**
- `type`: `jsonline`, `loki`, `elasticsearch`, `datadog`, `opentelemetry`, `journald`, `syslog`
**Description:** Log entries successfully parsed and added to the processing pipeline. Counts all entries that pass initial validation, including debug entries that are processed but not stored when `debug=1` is used.

### vl_bytes_ingested_total
**Type:** Counter
**Labels:**
- `type`: ingestion protocol
**Description:** Estimated JSON size of ingested log entry fields. Calculated using field name lengths and values to provide consistent volume measurement across different input formats like JSON, Loki, or syslog.

### vl_rows_dropped_total
**Type:** Counter
**Labels:**

**Description:** Log entries rejected for specific reasons. `debug` counts entries processed with `debug=1` (parsed but not stored). `too_many_fields` counts entries exceeding `-insert.maxFieldsPerLine`. `too_small_timestamp` counts entries older than `-retentionPeriod`. `too_big_timestamp` counts entries newer than `-futureRetention`.

### vl_insert_flush_duration_seconds
**Type:** Summary
**Labels:**

**Description:** Time taken to flush accumulated logs from memory buffers to storage. Triggered when buffers fill up or during periodic flushes (every ~1 second with jitter). High values suggest storage bottlenecks or slow disk performance.

### vl_too_long_lines_skipped_total
**Type:** Counter
**Description:** Log lines exceeding `-insert.maxLineSizeBytes` (default 256KB) during parsing. Lines are skipped to prevent memory exhaustion. Indicates malformed data, overly verbose logs, or need to increase the size limit.

## Storage System Metrics

### vl_data_size_bytes
**Type:** Gauge
**Labels:**
- `type`: `storage`, `indexdb`
**Description:** Current disk space used by log data and indexes. `storage` shows compressed log data across all storage tiers (inmemory + small + big parts). `indexdb` shows space used by search indexes for stream fields and log filtering.

### vl_compressed_data_size_bytes
**Type:** Gauge
**Labels:**
- `type`: `storage/inmemory`, `storage/small`, `storage/big`

### vl_uncompressed_data_size_bytes
**Type:** Gauge
**Labels:**

**Description:** Number of log entries in each storage tier. Shows data distribution: `inmemory` has fresh logs not yet written to disk, `small` has recently flushed data, `big` has data from completed merge operations.

### vl_storage_parts
**Type:** Gauge
**Labels:**
- `type`: storage tier
**Description:** Number of storage parts (data files) in each tier. More parts mean fragmentation; fewer parts suggest successful merging. High part counts may slow queries and trigger background merge operations.

### vl_storage_blocks
**Type:** Gauge
**Labels:**
- `type`: storage tier
**Description:** Number of data blocks within storage parts. Blocks are the smallest units of compressed data storage. Higher block counts within parts mean more granular data organization.

### vl_pending_rows
**Type:** Gauge
**Labels:**
- `type`: `storage`, `indexdb`
**Description:** Log entries waiting in memory buffers before being written to disk. `storage` counts log data awaiting flush. `indexdb` counts index entries awaiting flush. High values suggest ingestion rate exceeds storage write speed.

### vl_partitions

**Labels:**
- `type`: `storage/inmemory`, `storage/small`, `storage/big`, `indexdb/inmemory`, `indexdb/file`

### vl_merges_total
**Type:** Counter
**Labels:**
- `type`: `storage/inmemory`, `storage/small`, `storage/big`, `indexdb/inmemory`, `indexdb/file`
**Description:** Total completed merge operations since startup. Background mergers consolidate parts to reduce fragmentation and improve query performance. Higher rates suggest active data ingestion and normal storage optimization.
